# python-challenge

#I was only able to complete this assigment with help from leaning assisants and a tutor.

#The polling analysis was particularly difficult and I utilized code that was provided by a learning assitant when defining the dictionary and determining the winner of the popular vote. My tutor helped futher explain it. 

#I was attempting to create a dictionary with mutliple key, value pairs and then append them. The assistant and I went through a couple options and they suggested using ".items" function to sort of create a dictionary as we were iterating. I would have never come up with this on my own. But in the end, not only did it work, but it created much cleaner code. Instead of of mutliple key, value pairs, a dictionary was created with one key, "name," with mutiple values for each candidate, votes, and percentages. Once I had this, it was able to complete the assigment.

#The results are printed in a text file in the analysis folder and the file is called "Results."
